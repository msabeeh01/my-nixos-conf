# My Nixos Configuarion
## Author: msabeeh01
### Repo information
This is my basic nixos conf (for now) that is a good starting place for modularization, uses flakes, configuration.nix, and home-manager for best of all worlds but mainly depends on flakes/configuration.nix 
### Why I use nixos?: Distrobox cannot run nixos but nixos can run Distrobox, plus other cool features in nixos like:
* nix-shell (try out stuff or create a FHS env for things that need it)
* rollbacks that makes stuff easy to repair
* declarative environments that ensure reproducability (good incase you blow something up)
